Abstract:

Poor medication adherence leads to adverse health outcomes as well as increased healthcare costs. Pharmacists, as the most accessible healthcare providers to the public, are uniquely positioned to provide patients with recommendations for improvements in medication adherence. The rise of smartphone technology provides new ways to approach medication adherence through the use of mobile applications, a multimodal adherence improvement tool. A multitude of applications are currently available for download and appropriate mobile application recommendations will vary depending on patient-specific health factors, mobile application features, as well as smartphone availability. While studies show that mobile application use can improve disease state management, individual applications lack data to support their own use and efficacy. Continued advancements in mobile application technology have important implications for improvement of patient health behaviors and outcomes. Pharmacists that are well educated on the availability and benefits of these resources will be able to guide patients toward better medication adherence.
